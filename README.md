# Sprint_4_Project
TripleTen Sprint 4 Project for Software Development Tools

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to show analytical data on a website, using streamlit, GitHub and Render. 
It shows 8 charts about car sales listings and prices by paint color and model year.

app.py is the file that executes the site, using streamlit. it requires the presence of vehicles_us.csv to operate.
The \notebooks folder contains a Jupyter notebook where the EDA was performed, to develop the contents of app.py.
The \.streamlit folder contains the config.toml which tells Render how to build and deploy the site a la streamlit.
The .gitignore file tells git what local files to ignore when pushing new builds into the repository.
The requirements.txt file tells Render what versions of the Python packages to use.
